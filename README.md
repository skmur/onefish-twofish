## üêü One fish, two fish, or the whole sea: Do LLM judgements capture population variability? 

RQ: Is there a difference between simulating multiple unique individuals by: increasing temperature vs. prompting to elicit different distributions vs. using different models?
- H1: One LLM = one individual
    - Sampling from a model‚Äôs distribution (with sufficiently high temperature OR prompting) is like sampling responses from an individual.
- H2: One LLM = one population
    - Sampling from a model‚Äôs distribution (with sufficiently high temperature OR prompting) is like sampling responses across individuals in a population.

### replication

To reproduce, run files in this order:
1. `./input-data/get-prompts.py`: filters English Wikipedia to remove people and disambiguation pages, outputs 100 prompts for each prompting strategy
    - Color task:
        1. `./replicate color task/[model_name].py`: queries model for two color associations for each word in `./input-data/colorref.csv`, computes internal deltaE for these responses, and queries model for expected population agreement for 2nd sample of association
        2. `./replicate color task/analyze-data.py`: compute population deltaE based off block1 and block2 associations, plot population deltaE vs internal deltaE
    - Concept task:
